# Project Express API

A solo project were I created an API using data from a hardcoded jsonfile. It includes 5 endpoints that GET data using the methods .sort(), .map(), .find(), .filter() and .slice()

## The problem

I used the Technigo boilerplate and followed the instructions. First I tried using a cheese-api but somewhere in the json I created, there was a problem and I didn't have time to solve it so I settled for the music data from the assignment. I chose some fun data to create endpoins for.

If I had more time I'd do the cheese-api. That is for the future!
